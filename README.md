#Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock Game

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a fun and expanded variation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors. 
It introduces two additional options, "Lizard" and "Spock," to reduce the chances of ties and add complexity. 
The game operates on a system of interactions where each choice can win against two others and lose to two others. 
Here's how the options interact:

Rock crushes Scissors and crushes Lizard.
Paper covers Rock and disproves Spock.
Scissors cuts Paper and decapitates Lizard.
Lizard eats Paper and poisons Spock.
Spock smashes Scissors and vaporizes Rock.
